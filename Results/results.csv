The former Notre Dame standout would have been a steal for the Dallas Cowboys in the 2016 Pro Bowl.

Kwiatkoski has played for the Cowboys and the Chicago Bears, and his experience with the Bears has been great, too.
I've been told by some scouts that the Bears would be willing to spend $12 million on a linebacker, which makes sense considering the Bears have a wide receiver group that includes three players who have been with the team for at least eight years.
The Bears certainly would love to sign a linebacker like Kwiatkoski, but they would be taking some big risks in free agency. There were rumors that the Bears were going to spend more on a linebacker, as the team had a strong need for a linebacker that can play as a safety.
Instead, the Bears have spent some money on a defensive end, signing a free agent in Ryan Howard. Howard is currently on the Raiders' practice squad, which means that he will be a free agent in 2016.
